- Copy all the code from your project to that clone (including gitignore files BUT IGNORING .git FOLDER (its hidden, so to view if you have added type `ls -a` after copying everything, if its there remove it by typing `rm -rf .git` in the repo youre gonna do the Pull Request!!!!). 
- Commit all your code and push it to your fork.
- Send a pull request (feel free to add a comment to your PR, in case it's useful for the reviewer).
- Send a message on Slack to who is in charge of your code review, with a link to the pull request.
