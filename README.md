# Codeworks code reviews

This repo is used to do code reviews for entire projects from students.

## How it works

- Fork this repo and clone the fork on your computer.
- Copy all the code from your project to that clone (including gitignore files BUT IGNORING .git FOLDER from your repo, so the best thing is to drag and drop the files in your root, not the actual folder containing all the files) 
- Commit all your code and push it to your fork.
- Send a pull request (feel free to add a comment to your PR, in case it's useful for the reviewer).
- Send a message on Slack to who is in charge of your code review, with a link to the pull request.
- You will receive a notification once the code review is completed.
